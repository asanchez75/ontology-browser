TODO
- cross browser check
- does MenuBarDoclet need to be in OWLHTML?

  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037035&group_id=90989&atid=595534

Bugs

- too many roots in ontology hierarchy (caused by loop?)
    - http://localhost:8080/browser/ontologies/?session=12a12e51055-2-12a12e6b79d
- DL query - hook up to reasoner
- individuals summary - how do we get to other types?
- reload ontology that is imported breaks the import

Features

- extra boxes needed on
    - property
    - annotation prop
    - indivs - property assertions
- add email or reporting link with permalink on error pages (permalink works nicely for reproduceability)
