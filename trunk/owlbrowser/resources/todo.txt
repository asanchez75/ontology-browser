TODO
----
- cross browser check
- revert hack in ClassHierarchyProvider when OWL API fixed (check implicit roots in wine ontology)
  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037035&group_id=90989&atid=595534

Bugs
----

- layout of Model options
- no permalink on All individuals page
- individuals summary - how do we get to other types?
- reload ontology that is imported breaks the import closure (not related to version IRIs)
  OWL API bug - mngr.getImportsClosure() does not return the reloaded ontology
  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037128&group_id=90989&atid=595534
- if FaCT++ fails to work, it silently switches to the structural reasoner (which fails to classify class expressions)
- DL query "[" causes ajax error messages
- Cross browser bugs
  - IE7 summary content rendering below hierarchies (float not working)
  - Find box rendering too low
  - load box, bookmarks rendered too low

Features
--------

- Axiom annotations in non-axiom views (ie other than usage)
- scrolling of hierachies when selection changes
- clouds for annotation properties, datatypes
- extra boxes needed on
    - property
    - annotation prop
    - indivs - property assertions
- Add email or reporting link with permalink on error pages (permalink works nicely for reproduceability)
- Axiom pages (axiom by type)
- DLQuery should state if the class expression is unsatisfiable instead of bringing back all superclasses/ancestors
