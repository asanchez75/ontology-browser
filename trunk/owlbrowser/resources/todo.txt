TODO
----
- cross browser check
- revert hack in ClassHierarchyProvider when OWL API fixed (check implicit roots in wine ontology)
  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037035&group_id=90989&atid=595534

Bugs
----

- individuals summary - how do we get to other types?
- if FaCT++ fails to work, it silently switches to the structural reasoner (which fails to classify class expressions)
- DLQuery photography.owl hasMinimumFocalDistance some int[>5]
  see http://localhost:8080/browser/dlquery/?expression=hasMinimumFocalDistance+some+int%5B%3E5%5D&syntax=man&session=12a5e4e71e5-2-12a5e4e9c31
  can't get any trace out of owlapi even rebuilding everything - god knows if tomcat is caching something

Features
--------

- ontologies by syntax (RDFXML, Man syntax etc) ontologies/1234567/rdfxml/ etc
- Axiom annotations in non-axiom views (ie other than usage)
- scrolling of hierachies when selection changes
- clouds for annotation properties, datatypes
- extra boxes needed on
    - property
    - annotation prop
    - indivs - property assertions
    - puns
- Axiom pages (axiom by type)
- DLQuery should state if the class expression is unsatisfiable instead of bringing back all superclasses/ancestors
