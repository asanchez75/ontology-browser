TODO
----
- cross browser check

- revert hack in ClassHierarchyProvider when OWL API fixed (check implicit roots in wine ontology)
  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037035&group_id=90989&atid=595534


Bugs
----

- individuals summary - how do we get to other types?

- if FaCT++ fails to work, it silently switches to the structural reasoner (which fails to classify class expressions)

- DLQuery photography.owl hasMinimumFocalDistance some integer[> 5]
  cannot use int as this is not known in the ontology.
  either way we get errors - maybe add xsd datatypes in OWLServerImpl.getNameCache()

- reload photography/index.owl - cannot select another active ontology without reloading again
  the url contains action=reload
  the action pages should probably redirect (but how do we provide a message?)
