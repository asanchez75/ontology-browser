Bugs
----

- individuals summary - how do we get to other types?
- reload ontology that is imported breaks the import closure (not related to version IRIs)
  OWL API bug - mngr.getImportsClosure() does not return the reloaded ontology
  see bug at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3037128&group_id=90989&atid=595534
- if FaCT++ fails to work, it silently switches to the structural reasoner (which fails to classify class expressions)

Features
--------

- ontologies by syntax (RDFXML, Man syntax etc) ontologies/1234567/rdfxml/ etc
- Axiom annotations in non-axiom views (ie other than usage)
- scrolling of hierachies when selection changes
- clouds for annotation properties, datatypes
- extra boxes needed on
    - property
    - annotation prop
    - indivs - property assertions
    - puns
- Axiom pages (axiom by type)
- DLQuery should state if the class expression is unsatisfiable instead of bringing back all superclasses/ancestors
